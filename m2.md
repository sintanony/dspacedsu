Certainly! I'll provide you with a Python script that takes the "dsu_library_entries.xlsx" file as input, processes the links, and creates a new Excel file with the modified download links. This script will handle the scenarios you mentioned, including replacing spaces with "%20" and attempting both .pdf and .tif extensions. Here's the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
from urllib.parse import quote

def process_link(row):
    base_link = row['Link'].replace('handle', 'bitstream')
    title = row['Title'].replace(' ', '%20')
    
    # Try PDF first
    pdf_link = f"{base_link}/1/{quote(title)}.pdf"
    if check_link(pdf_link):
        return pdf_link
    
    # If PDF fails, try TIF
    tif_link = f"{base_link}/1/{quote(title)}.tif"
    if check_link(tif_link):
        return tif_link
    
    # If both fail, return the original link
    return row['Link']

def check_link(url):
    try:
        response = requests.head(url, timeout=5)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except requests.RequestException:
        return False

# Read the input Excel file
input_file = "dsu_library_entries.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(input_file)

# Process each row and create a new 'Download_Link' column
df['Download_Link'] = df.apply(process_link, axis=1)

# Save the results to a new Excel file
output_file = "dsu_library_download_links.xlsx"
df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)

print(f"Processing complete. Results saved to {output_file}")
```

This script does the following:

1. It imports the necessary libraries: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for Excel handling and [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for checking link validity.

2. The `process_link` function takes a row from the DataFrame and:
   - Replaces 'handle' with 'bitstream' in the base link.
   - Replaces spaces with '%20' in the title.
   - Tries to create a PDF link first, then a TIF link if the PDF fails.
   - Uses `urllib.parse.quote` to properly encode the title for URLs.

3. The `check_link` function uses a HEAD request to check if a link is valid without downloading the entire file.

4. The script reads the input Excel file "dsu_library_entries.xlsx".

5. It applies the `process_link` function to each row, creating a new 'Download_Link' column.

6. Finally, it saves the results to a new Excel file named "dsu_library_download_links.xlsx".

To use this script:

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas requests openpyxl
   ```

2. Place the script in the same directory as your "dsu_library_entries.xlsx" file.

3. Run the script. It will create a new Excel file "dsu_library_download_links.xlsx" with the processed download links.

This script handles the cases you mentioned:
- It tries both .pdf and .tif extensions.
- It properly encodes spaces and special characters in the title.
- If both PDF and TIF links fail, it falls back to the original link.

The resulting Excel file will contain properly formatted links that you can directly use with IDM for downloading.
