I apologize for the oversight. You're right, we should explicitly handle spaces in the title by replacing them with "%20". Let's modify the script to include this scenario:



```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
from urllib.parse import quote

def process_links(input_file, output_file):
    # Read the Excel file
    df = pd.read_excel(input_file)

    # Function to process each link
    def process_link(row):
        original_link = row['Link']
        title = row['Title']
        
        # Replace 'handle' with 'bitstream' and modify the link structure
        new_link = original_link.replace('handle', 'bitstream').replace('/jspui', '', 1)
        
        # Replace spaces with %20 in the title
        encoded_title = title.replace(' ', '%20')
        
        # Construct the new link with the encoded title
        new_link = f"{new_link}/1/{encoded_title}.pdf"
        
        # Check if .pdf exists, if not try .tif
        response = requests.head(new_link)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            new_link = new_link.replace('.pdf', '.tif')
            response = requests.head(new_link)
            if response.status_code != 200:
                return "File not found"
        
        return new_link

    # Apply the processing function to each row
    df['Download_Link'] = df.apply(process_link, axis=1)

    # Remove rows where file was not found
    df = df[df['Download_Link'] != "File not found"]

    # Export to a new Excel file
    df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)

    print(f"Processed links exported to {output_file}")

# Usage
input_file = 'dsu_library_entries.xlsx'
output_file = 'dsu_library_download_links.xlsx'
process_links(input_file, output_file)

```

In this updated version:

1. We've modified the `process_link` function to explicitly replace spaces with "%20" in the title:
   ```python
   encoded_title = title.replace(' ', '%20')
   ```

2. We then use this `encoded_title` when constructing the new link:
   ```python
   new_link = f"{new_link}/1/{encoded_title}.pdf"
   ```

This change ensures that all spaces in the title are replaced with "%20", making the URLs properly formatted for download managers like IDM.

The rest of the script remains the same, including:
- Checking for both .pdf and .tif file extensions
- Removing entries where files are not found
- Exporting the results to a new Excel file

To use this updated script:

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas requests openpyxl
   ```

2. Place this script in the same directory as your "dsu_library_entries.xlsx" file.

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python link_processor.py
   ```

This script will create a new Excel file "dsu_library_download_links.xlsx" with the modified download links, ensuring that:
- Spaces in titles are replaced with "%20"
- Links are checked for both .pdf and .tif extensions
- Only valid links are included in the final output

This should provide you with properly formatted links that are ready to be used with Internet Download Manager (IDM) or similar download tools.
