To scrape the data from the given website, including pagination, and export it to Excel, you can use Python with libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas. Here's a Python script that should accomplish this task:



```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def scrape_page(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    titles = []
    links = []
    
    table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'table'})
    rows = table.find_all('tr')[1:]  # Skip the header row
    
    for row in rows:
        title_cell = row.find('td', headers='t2')
        if title_cell:
            a_tag = title_cell.find('a')
            if a_tag:
                titles.append(a_tag.text.strip())
                links.append("http://192.168.2.203:8080" + a_tag['href'])
    
    return titles, links

def scrape_all_pages():
    base_url = "http://192.168.2.203:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/5/browse"
    params = {
        "type": "title",
        "sort_by": "1",
        "order": "ASC",
        "rpp": "100",
        "etal": "0",
        "submit_browse": "Update"
    }
    
    all_titles = []
    all_links = []
    
    while True:
        url = base_url + "?" + "&".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in params.items()])
        titles, links = scrape_page(url)
        
        if not titles:  # If no titles are found, we've reached the end
            break
        
        all_titles.extend(titles)
        all_links.extend(links)
        
        # Update offset for next page
        params['offset'] = params.get('offset', 0) + 100
        
        print(f"Scraped {len(all_titles)} entries so far...")
    
    return all_titles, all_links

# Scrape all pages
titles, links = scrape_all_pages()

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Title': titles,
    'Link': links
})

# Export to Excel
excel_file = 'dsu_library_entries.xlsx'
df.to_excel(excel_file, index=False)

print(f"Data exported to {excel_file}")

```

This script does the following:

1. It defines a `scrape_page` function to extract titles and links from a single page.
2. The `scrape_all_pages` function handles pagination by updating the offset parameter and calling `scrape_page` for each page until no more entries are found.
3. After scraping all pages, it creates a pandas DataFrame with the collected data.
4. Finally, it exports the data to an Excel file named 'dsu_library_entries.xlsx'.

To use this script:

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl
   ```

2. Copy the script into a Python file (e.g., `dsu_scraper.py`).

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python dsu_scraper.py
   ```

The script will scrape all pages, printing progress updates, and will create an Excel file with all the entries when finished.

Note: This script assumes that the structure of the web page remains consistent. If the website's structure changes, you may need to modify the scraping logic accordingly.

Also, please be mindful of the website's terms of service and consider adding delays between requests if scraping a large number of pages to avoid overloading the server.
