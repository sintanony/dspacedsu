Here's a Python script that will scrape the titles and their corresponding hyperlinks from the given website, navigate through all pages, and export the data to an Excel file:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def scrape_page(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    titles = []
    links = []
    
    table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'table'})
    if table:
        rows = table.find_all('tr')[1:]  # Skip the header row
        for row in rows:
            title_cell = row.find('td', headers='t2')
            if title_cell:
                link = title_cell.find('a')
                if link:
                    titles.append(link.text.strip())
                    links.append('http://192.168.2.203:8080' + link['href'])
    
    next_link = soup.find('a', string='next')
    next_url = 'http://192.168.2.203:8080' + next_link['href'] if next_link else None
    
    return titles, links, next_url

def scrape_all_pages(start_url):
    all_titles = []
    all_links = []
    current_url = start_url
    
    while current_url:
        print(f"Scraping: {current_url}")
        titles, links, next_url = scrape_page(current_url)
        all_titles.extend(titles)
        all_links.extend(links)
        current_url = next_url
    
    return all_titles, all_links

# Start URL
start_url = "http://192.168.2.203:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/5/browse?type=title&sort_by=1&order=ASC&rpp=100&etal=0&submit_browse=Update"

# Scrape all pages
titles, links = scrape_all_pages(start_url)

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Title': titles,
    'Link': links
})

# Export to Excel
excel_file = 'scraped_data.xlsx'
df.to_excel(excel_file, index=False)
print(f"Data exported to {excel_file}")
```

This script does the following:

1. We define a `scrape_page` function that scrapes a single page, extracting titles and links.

2. The `scrape_all_pages` function uses `scrape_page` to iterate through all pages by following the "next" link until there are no more pages.

3. We start with the initial URL and scrape all pages.

4. The scraped data is stored in a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame.

5. Finally, we export the DataFrame to an Excel file named 'scraped_data.xlsx'.

To use this script, you'll need to install the required libraries:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl
```

Then run the script. It will print the URL of each page as it's being scraped and finally inform you when the data has been exported to the Excel file.

Note: Make sure you have permission to scrape this website and that you're not violating any terms of service. Also, be mindful of the load you're putting on the server - you might want to add a delay between requests if you're scraping a large number of pages.
